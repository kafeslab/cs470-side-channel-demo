- **simpleserial-modexp.c**: STM32F0 firmware that computes exponentiation using d and N with square and multiply algorithm
- **power_trace.png**: Result of our power analysis from the jupyter notebook. d = 41
- **RSAPowerDemo.html**: Offline jupyter notebook showing how we ran the demo to get power_trace.png using ChipwhispererNano in class. The demo requires Chipwhisperer hardware. 
Feel free to come during office hours if you would like to see the attack again.

- **branch.c**: Brench prediction side channel demo, only works on x86 architectures.
